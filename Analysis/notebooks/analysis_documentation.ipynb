    "Findings:\n",
    "1. Investigated the oscillating nature of observation against time in PCA space, found that the oscillation came from data queried from `multiDimMatrix`.\n",
    "2. Used the new grouping algorithm on Aug 19th raw data, and computed the linearly summed observation against time.\n",
    "3. Compared the summed observation of data grouped by the old algorithm and the new algorithm, discovered discrepancy\n",
    "4. Found the underlying problem in the new query algorithm, which skips data points if the quantization remainder does not fall into certain bins and accumulates multiple data points into one bin.\n",
    "5. Solved by increasing bin/sampling size from 8 ms to 16 ms, and average data points within 1 bin."

    "NEXT WEEK:\n",
    "1. (Rearrange the chairs) Number each chair, to record the experiments, talk while sitting in the chair and switching between chairs. Write down how you move as you move, and record with cameras as well.\n",
    "2. Recording mode:\n",
    "    - precise mode: fix the sound source on the table/chair\n",
    "    - moving mode: move around the sound source the chair\n",
    "3. Pick 5-6 fixed positions, record a truth set of coordinates for each position, from various angle, e.g. for chairs:\n",
